This vignette explains what the table contains, why I bundled it as a package, and how to open the app.

- The table summarises probability ratios (PR), “times more likely” for extreme Fire Weather Index events.
- Values are derived from the published figure/text; they’re meant for communication, not forecasting.


```{r}
library(fireRiskR)
# launch_app()
```
